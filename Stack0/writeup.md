# STACK-ZERO
## Solution writeup

The source code for stack-zero is given as the following:

```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <unistd.h>

#define BANNER \
  "Welcome to " LEVELNAME ", brought to you by https://exploit.education"

char *gets(char *);

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
  struct {
    char buffer[64];
    volatile int changeme;
  } locals;

  printf("%s\n", BANNER);

  locals.changeme = 0;
  gets(locals.buffer);

  if (locals.changeme != 0) {
    puts("Well done, the 'changeme' variable has been changed!");
  } else {
    puts(
        "Uh oh, 'changeme' has not yet been changed. Would you like to try "
        "again?");
  }

  exit(0);
}
```

The goal of this challenge is simply to change the variable called 'changeme'. The program reads in data using 'gets', 
and writes it to a char buffer of length 64. Altering this variable is easy, as all you need to do is write past the 
bounds of the buffer. The ruby solution to this program sends 65 'A's to stdout, and this can be redirected to the program.

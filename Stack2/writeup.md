# STACK-TWO
## Solution writeup

The source code for stack-two is given as the following:

```
#include <err.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <unistd.h>

#define BANNER \
  "Welcome to " LEVELNAME ", brought to you by https://exploit.education"

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
  struct {
    char buffer[64];
    volatile int changeme;
  } locals;

  char *ptr;

  printf("%s\n", BANNER);

  ptr = getenv("ExploitEducation");
  if (ptr == NULL) {
    errx(1, "please set the ExploitEducation environment variable");
  }

  locals.changeme = 0;
  strcpy(locals.buffer, ptr);

  if (locals.changeme == 0x0d0a090a) {
    puts("Well done, you have successfully set changeme to the correct value");
  } else {
    printf("Almost! changeme is currently 0x%08x, we want 0x0d0a090a\n",
        locals.changeme);
  }

  exit(0);
}
```

This challenge is almost the same as the last, except the data is no longer given to the program through 
stdin, but rather through an environment variable. A ruby program is made that supplies the neccessary payload, 
and an environment variable is set using command interpolation to store this payload. It is also possible to 
use a shell script to create the environment variable local to that program.

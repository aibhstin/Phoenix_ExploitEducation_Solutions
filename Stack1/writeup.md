# STACK-ONE
## Solution writeup

The source code for stack-one is given as follows:

```
#include <err.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <unistd.h>

#define BANNER \
  "Welcome to " LEVELNAME ", brought to you by https://exploit.education"

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
  struct {
    char buffer[64];
    volatile int changeme;
  } locals;

  printf("%s\n", BANNER);

  if (argc < 2) {
    errx(1, "specify an argument, to be copied into the \"buffer\"");
  }

  locals.changeme = 0;
  strcpy(locals.buffer, argv[1]);

  if (locals.changeme == 0x496c5962) {
    puts("Well done, you have successfully set changeme to the correct value");
  } else {
    printf("Getting closer! changeme is currently 0x%08x, we want 0x496c5962\n",
        locals.changeme);
  }

  exit(0);
}
```

As opposed to the previous challenge, this time specific data must be written to the 'changeme' variable. Once again, 
my solution starts by writing 64 'A's to stdout, but this is followed by the specific hexadecimal data (written to account 
for endianness).
